# <Portfolio>

## Description

For this project, I have created a personal portfolio webpage to display my understanding of HTML and CSS. I undertook this task to exercise my knowledge, practice syntax and formatting, and provide employers with a reference for my skills and background. By creating this, I solved provided information such as:
- A header section
- An 'about me' section with an image of me
- A work section containing projects
- A footer containing contact information

Please note that I was never taught how to resize an image to squeeze in .md parameters. I lost points for not having an image on my .md last time. Above is beyond what this course has offered/taught me.

## Usage

Feel free to dissect the attached files to se what I did under the hood. You can also find the live webpage at https://ryanh610.github.io/portfolio/
